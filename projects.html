            My first project is a 2D platformer called SpaceGame2D.<br>
            It was an learn and do project.<br>
            Theres not much you can do in this game.<br>
            Your goal is to collect ten bones from your spaceship.<br>
            At the same time you need to either kill or evaide your enemies.<br>
            The game is short and it could use some improvements.<br>
