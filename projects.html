            My first project is a 2D platformer called SpaceGame2D.<br>
            It was an learn and do project.<br>
            Theres not much you can do in this game.<br>
            Your goal is to collect ten bones from your spaceship.<br>
            At the same time you need to either kill or evaide your enemies.<br>
            The game is short and it could use some improvements.<br>

            My second project was an unity 3D game, which was a group project but i did most of it my self.<br>
            In this project I practiced using unitys 3D features.<br>
            In this game your goal is to find certain items which<br>
            unlock new areas of the game map.<br>
            The game environment is a sewer where you need to kill enemyes in the difrent rooms and challenge the boss in the last room.<br>
            The game is pretty short and it could use some improvements.<br>
