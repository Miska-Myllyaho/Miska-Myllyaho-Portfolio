            My first project is a 2D platformer called SpaceGame2D.<br>
            It was an learn and do project, which was done with unity 2D and C#.<br>
            <br>
            Your goal is to collect ten bones from your spaceship.<br>
            At the same time you need to either kill or evaide your enemies.<br>
            <br>
            The game is short and it could use some improvements.<br>

            My second project was an unity 3D game, which was a group project but i did most of it my self.<br>
            In this project I practiced using unitys 3D features.<br>
            This project was made with unity 3D and C#.<br>
            <br>
            In this game your goal is to find certain items which<br>
            unlock new areas of the game map.<br>
            The game environment is a sewer where you need to kill enemyes in the difrent rooms and challenge the boss in the last room.<br>
            <br>
            The game is pretty short and it could use some improvements.<br>

            My third project was a VR learning game for children.<br>
            This was a group project that we did for a school.<br>
            <br>
            This project was made with unity 3D and C#, for oculus meta quest 2 VR glasses.<br>
            <br>
            The games idea is to teach diffrent school subjects like math for the kids.<br>
            <br>
            My group started this project but it will be probably continued by some other group in the future.<br>
            <br>
            In this project I mostly focused on building the game level but I did some coding as well.<br>

            My fourth project was a simple 2D Pong game which I made with a classmate.<br>
            <br>
            This project was made using python, pyCharm and some libraries.<br>
            <br>
            In this game you need to move your padle in front of the ball moving your own hand.<br>
            <br>
            This game tracks your hand using an webcam.<br>
            You can play this game alone or with an friend.<br>
            This game was suposed to be something that could be placed in the schools lobby for the students<br>
            to play and get some movement while they do that.<br>

            My fifth project is an 2D game where you adventure along a path<br>
            to end up in a village where you need to investigate some house room by room<br>
            and you always need to start from the start of the path after clearing a room.<br>
            The game gets harder with every cleared room.<br>
            <br>
            This game is currently a working progress.<br>
            This game is being made with unity 2D and C#<br>
