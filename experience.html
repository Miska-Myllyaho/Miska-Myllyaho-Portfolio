            Im currently studying programing<br>
            at OSAO Kaukovainio Technical Unit.<br>
            <br>
            I have done one internship at linnakankaankoulu in Kempele,<br>
            in there I worked on a VR-game in a small group.<br>
            The game was a lerning game ment for children,<br>
            it's purpose was to make learning school subjects<br>
            easier and more fun for the children.<br>
            <br>
            I did an internship in an community project called AltZone.<br>
            All the communication in the project was done in discord.<br>
            They develope a small but ambitious mobile game which the plan to market<br>
            first for schools and then for open use.<br>
            <br>
            I had a sumerjob where I mowed lawn and repainted<br>
            walls and many other things,<br>
            also I chopped some wood in there.
